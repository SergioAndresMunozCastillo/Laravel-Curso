---------------Notes-------------------
*We can limit what the end-user can see using the @can() and @endcan to disable and make
invisible whaterer inside, in this case it was something like 
@can('update-conversation', $conversation)


*In /Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php there you can make the key 'update-conversation' 
(or whatever name you want) and asocciate it with a function.

*Authorization 101:

	-Go to /Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php and inside the boot function make 
	Gate::define ('key-name', function what to do)

	-In any page you can reference your key inside @can() and the variable that holds whatever
	useful for the function inside Gate::define
