-----------NOTES-------------------------

*Layout pages are pretty much a view file which contains all the generic content that every other page
will have, so you don't have to write the same script on different view, or CSS and so on.

*In the layout page we put @yield('view_tag') to insert the content of a view with said tag

*@section('view_tag') to begin the code which the layout page will take if called

*@endsection to close the code which  the layout page will take.

*@extends('layout_page_name') in the view with unique content to specify to wich layout page will send its unique content or code.
